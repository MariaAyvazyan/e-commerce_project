Analizing the company's sales and conducting RFM segmentation.
## Project description.

You work as a data analyst in an e-commerce company. Company's Product Manager asked you to analyze the purchases made on company's website and answer the following questions:

1. How many users with only a single purchase do we have?

2. How many orders per month, on average, are not delivered for various reasons? 

3. For each product, determine on which day of the week the product is most frequently bought.

4. How many purchases does each user make on average per week (by months)? 

5. Using pandas, conduct a cohort analysis. Identify the cohort with the highest retention rate for the 3rd month between January and December. 

6. Using Python, perform RFM customer segmentation to analyze your audience. Describe in detail how you created the clusters. Classify the customers based on the individual recency, frequency and monetary scores and describe how you computed these scores.
